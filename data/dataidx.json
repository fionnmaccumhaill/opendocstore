This approach was created when Connecticut and 49 other states signed an agreement with the National Governors’ Association to develop a uniform system for tracking students.  The four-year cohort graduation rate is calculated by tracking an individual cohort, or group of students, from their initial entrance into Grade 9 through to graduation. The four-year cohort graduation rate represents the percentage of students who earn a standard high school diploma within four years. The calculation uses individual student-level data from the state's Public School Information System (PSIS) that school districts submitted and superintendents certified.\n\nNotes: \nDouble plus symbol (††) denotes not applicable; \nAsterisk symbol (*) denotes fewer than six in a cohort is suppressed;\nOut-placed students are counted only in district graduation calculation;\nRow percentages may not add to 100 percent because of rounding;\nDistrict graduation rates may not be the same as the average of the graduation rates of the number schools in that district because of out-placed students.\n\nGov.

According to research conducted by the College Board*, a score of 1550 indicates that a student will have a 65 percent or greater likelihood of achieving a B- average or higher during the first year of college.\n\nThis dataset also provides an estimated SAT Participation Rate, which equals the number of SAT test-taking seniors in the school divided by the number of seniors enrolled in the school as a percentage.  These participation rates are considered an estimate because the grade level of the SAT test-taker is self-reported by the student at the time of registration for the SAT while the total number of seniors enrolled in the school is reported to the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) by the district. These are the best available estimates of SAT participation rates.\n\nThe Benchmark Performance reflect the results of only those who participate in the SAT.  Because participation rates vary from school to school, the CSDE provides both the estimated Participation rates together with the Benchmark Performance in order to promote fair and valid comparisons across schools. \n\nNote: The data are suppressed when there are too few test-takers to sufficiently protect privacy.\n\n*The research report can be found at:\nhttp://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/7/researchreport-2011-5-sat-college-readiness-benchmark-secondary-performance.pdf"

Census Blocks are statistical areas which in Connecticut are typically bounded by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad lines. Generally, Census Blocks in denser urban communities are small in area, such as a block in a city that is bounded on all sides by streets. However, Census Blocks in suburban and rural areas may be large, or irregular, and bounded by a variety of features, such as roads or streams. For example, a specific Census Block may be partially served by public water and/or sewer, and thus the entire block would appear to be served by these utilities. There were several instances during the public comment period where municipalities requested that certain Census Blocks be removed from this classification, and such requests were granted. Any limitations in the use of Census Blocks in this LGM should not be construed as influencing local land use and zoning decisions or municipal plans of conservation and development; nor should it create any expectation for future utility service where none currently exists.\nPriority Funding Areas are classified by Census Blocks that include:  Designation as an Urban Area or Urban Cluster in the 2010 Census Boundaries that intersect a ½ mile buffer surrounding existing or planned mass-transit stations Existing or planned sewer service from an adopted Wastewater Facility Plan Existing or planned water service from an adopted Public Drinking Water Supply Plan Local bus service provided 7 days a week"

According to research conducted by the College Board*, a score of 1550 indicates that a student will have a 65 percent or greater likelihood of achieving a B- average or higher during the first year of college.\n\nThis dataset also provides an estimated SAT Participation Rate, which equals the number of SAT test-taking seniors in the district divided by the number of seniors enrolled in the district, as a percentage.  These participation rates are considered an estimate because the grade level of the SAT test-taker is self-reported by the student at the time of registration for the SAT while the total number of seniors enrolled in the district is reported to the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) by the district. These are the best available estimates of SAT participation rates.\n\nThe Benchmark Performance reflect the results of only those who participate in the SAT.  Because participation rates vary from district to district, the CSDE provides both the estimated Participation rates together with the Benchmark Performance in order to promote fair and valid comparisons across districts. \n\nNote: The data are suppressed when there are too few test-takers to sufficiently protect privacy.\n\n*The research report can be found at:\nhttp://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/7/researchreport-2011-5-sat-college-readiness-benchmark-secondary-performance.pdf"

Each report accepted is screened for safety and risk factors, and assigned an amount of time within which the agency is required to respond to the report.  Mandated response times include “Same Day”, “24 Hours”, and “72 Hours”.  Traditionally, DCF has had only one manner of responding to such reports, which was a mandated Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigation.  As of April 2012, DCF began responding to low-risk reports through a voluntary Family Assessment Response (FAR) process.  Reports handled through a FAR response still contain allegations that meet the statutory definitions of neglect, but they do not receive a decision concerning whether they are substantiated or not.  This policy has resulted in fewer substantiated allegations since its implementation, but the agency continues to serve as many or more families reported for abuse/neglect."

For a criminal offense to be “cleared,” either of the following situations must prevail: (1) at least one person is arrested, charged, and turned over to the court for prosecution; or (2) some element beyond police control precludes the physical arrest of the offender (e.g., death of offender, victim refuses to cooperate, confession by offender already in police custody), resulting in the offense being cleared by “exceptional means.” Contributing agencies also include data on the value of property stolen and recovered in connection with the reported offenses, plus specific information regarding homicides, officers assaulted and arson."
